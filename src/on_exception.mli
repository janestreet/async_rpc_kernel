  (** [Exception_type] represents whether the exception was raised before or after the
      implementation returned. When the callback itself is executing we could have already
      written a response to the peer so it doesn't represent the current state of the
      system (rather the state of the system when the exception was raised).

      Note that the callback in [Call] will be invoked within the monitor of the RPC
      connection. This means that if [Call] raises, it will be caught by the connection's
      monitor and shut down the connection, but will not propagate further. If you'd like
      the connection to propagate elsewhere, you should use [Monitor.send_exn] with a
      different monitor. *)
  | Log_on_background_exn
  (** Logs the exception if it was raised after the implementation returned. *)
  | Close_connection
  | Raise_to_monitor of Monitor.t
  (** Raises the exception to the given monitor. To shut down the whole program you can
   provide [Monitor.main]. Note that this applies both if the ecxception is thrown
   before the implementation returns or afterwards. *)
[@@deriving sexp_of]

(** Handle an exn that was raised before the implementation returned. It's possible that
    this function is called after we write a response to the peer but it's referring to an
    earlier exception. In that scenario the return type isn't really relevant since we've
    already written a response. *)
