(** A library for building asynchronous RPC-style protocols.

    The approach here is to have a separate representation of the server-side
    implementation of an RPC (An [Implementation.t]) and the interface that it exports
    (either an [Rpc.t], a [State_rpc.t] or a [Pipe_rpc.t], but we'll refer to them
    generically as RPC interfaces).  A server builds the [Implementation.t] out of an RPC
    interface and a function for implementing the RPC, while the client dispatches a
    request using the same RPC interface.

    The [Implementation.t] hides the type of the query and the response, whereas the
    [Rpc.t] is polymorphic in the query and response type.  This allows you to build a
    [Implementations.t] out of a list of [Implementation.t]s.

    Each RPC also comes with a version number.  This is meant to allow support of multiple
    different versions of what is essentially the same RPC.  You can think of it as an
    extension to the name of the RPC, and in fact, each RPC is uniquely identified by its
    (name, version) pair.  RPCs with the same name but different versions should implement
    similar functionality. *)

(** An RPC that has no response.  Error handling is trickier here than it is for RPCs with
    responses, as there is no reasonable place to put an error if something goes wrong.
    Because of this, in the event of an error such as dispatching to an unimplemented RPC,
    the connection will be shut down.  Similarly, if the implementation raises an
    exception, the connection will be shut down. *)
