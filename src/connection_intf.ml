    (** Each side of the connection has its own heartbeat config. It sends a heartbeat

        a heartbeat or not, it drops the connection. It only checks whether [timeout] has
        elapsed when it sends heartbeats, so effectively [timeout] is rounded up to the
        nearest multiple of [send_every]. *)

  (** Initiate an Rpc connection on the given transport. [implementations] should be the
      bag of implementations that the calling side implements; it defaults to
      [Implementations.null] (i.e., "I implement no RPCs").

      [protocol_version_headers] should contain the pre-shared protocol version headers,
      if applicable. The client and server must agree on whether these were shared and, if
      so, what they contained, or there may be a protocol error.

      [connection_state] will be called once, before [create]'s result is determined, on
      the same connection that [create] returns. Its output will be provided to the
      [implementations] when queries arrive.

      WARNING: If specifying a custom [heartbeat_config], make sure that both ends of the
      Rpc connection use compatible settings for timeout and send frequency. Otherwise,
      your Rpc connections might close unexpectedly.

      [max_metadata_size] will limit how many bytes of metadata this peer can send along
      with each query. It defaults to 1k. User-provided metadata exceeding that size will
      be truncated. WARNING: setting this value too high allows this connection to send
      large amounts of data to the callee, unnoticed, which can severely degrade
      performance.

      [description] can be used to give some extra information about the connection, which
      will then show up in error messages and the connection's sexp. If you have lots of
      connections in your program, this can be useful for distinguishing them.

      [time_source] can be given to define the time_source for which the heartbeating
      events will be scheduled. Defaults to wall-clock.

      [identification] can be used to send an additional information to the peer. This is
      intended to be used for identifying the identity of the /process/ as opposed to the
      identity of the user. We use a bigstring to leave the option for clients to
      interpret as structured data of their choosing.

      [reader_drain_timeout] determines how long the connection will try to drain the
      reader before closing a connection after noticing that its writer is closed. If the
      write end of the connection has closed, the connection will attempt to keep reading
      for up to this long from the read end to attempt to receive a close reason message.
      Default: 5s.

      [provide_rpc_shapes] configures whether the automatic menu sent to peers will
      contain the rpc shapes digests (and as a result whether or not we need to compute
      digests). Default: [false] *)

  (** [close] starts closing the connection's transport, and returns a deferred that
      becomes determined when its close completes. It is ok to call [close] multiple times
      on the same [t]; calls subsequent to the initial call will have no effect, but will
      return the same deferred as the original call.

      Before closing the underlying transport's writer, [close] waits for all streaming
      responses to be [Pipe.upstream_flushed] with a timeout of
      [streaming_responses_flush_timeout].

      The [reason] for closing the connection will be passed to callers of [close_reason]. *)

  (** [close_finished] becomes determined after the close of the connection's transport
      completes, i.e. the same deferred that [close] returns. [close_finished] differs
      from [close] in that it does not have the side effect of initiating a close. *)
  val close_finished : t -> unit Deferred.t

  (** [close_reason ~on_close t] becomes determined when close starts or finishes based on
      [on_close], but additionally returns the reason that the connection was closed. *)
  val close_reason : t -> on_close:[ `started | `finished ] -> Info.t Deferred.t

  (** [is_closed t] returns [true] iff [close t] has been called. [close] may be called
      internally upon errors or timeouts. *)
  val is_closed : t -> bool

  (** [bytes_to_write] and [flushed] just call the similarly named function on the
      [Transport.Writer.t] within a connection. *)
  val bytes_to_write : t -> int

  (** [bytes_written] just calls the similarly named functions on the [Transport.Writer.t]
      within a connection. *)
  val bytes_written : t -> Int63.t

      within a connection. *)
  val bytes_read : t -> Int63.t

  val flushed : t -> unit Deferred.t

  (** Peer menu will become determined before any other messages are received. The menu is
      sent automatically on creation of a connection. If the peer is using an older
      version, the value is immediately determined to be [None]. If the connection is
      closed before the menu is received, an error is returned.

      It is expected that one will call {!Versioned_rpc.Connection_with_menu.create}
      instead of this function and that will request the menu via rpc if it gets [None]. *)
  val peer_menu : t -> Menu.t option Or_error.t Deferred.t

  (** Like {!peer_menu} but returns an rpc result *)
  val peer_menu' : t -> Menu.t option Rpc_result.t Deferred.t

  val my_menu : t -> Menu.t option

  (** Peer identification will become determined before any other messages are received.
      If the peer is using an older version, the peer id is immediately determined to be
      [None]. If the connection is closed before the menu is received, [None] is returned. *)
  val peer_identification : t -> Bigstring.t option Deferred.t

  (** [with_close] tries to create a [t] using the given transport. If a handshake error
      is the result, it calls [on_handshake_error], for which the default behavior is to
      raise an exception. If no error results, [dispatch_queries] is called on [t].

      After [dispatch_queries] returns, if [server] is None, the [t] will be closed and
      the deferred returned by [dispatch_queries] will be determined immediately.
      Otherwise, we'll wait until the other side closes the connection and then close [t]
      and determine the deferred returned by [dispatch_queries].

      When the deferred returned by [with_close] becomes determined, [Transport.close] has
      finished.

      NOTE: Because this connection is closed when the [Deferred.t] returned by
      [dispatch_queries] is determined, you should be careful when using this with
      [Pipe_rpc]. For example, simply returning the pipe when you get it will close the
      pipe immediately. You should instead either use the pipe inside [dispatch_queries]
      and not determine its result until you are done with the pipe, or use a different
      function like [create]. *)
